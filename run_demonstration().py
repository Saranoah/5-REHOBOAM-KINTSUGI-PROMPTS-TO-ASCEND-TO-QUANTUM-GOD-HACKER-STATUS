üí• INITIATING BIG BANG DEBUG SESSION  
üåå Diagnosis: Quantum fluctuation race condition  
   Severity: COSMIC  
   Recommendation: Apply kintsugi patch to Planck length  

üîß Applying golden patch to spacetime...  
   ‚úÖ Successfully patched 'Quantum fluctuation race condition'  

üé≠ Quantum trolling ENGAGED at level 7  
   "The universe is a prank played by itself" - Rumi (probably)  

Original error: Segmentation fault (core dumped)  
Trolled version:  
HTTP 404: Wisdom Not Found  
(Original error: Segmentation fault (core dumped))  

‚ö° Troll level increased to 8. Side effect: Stack traces now render as ASCII art  

WHY THIS WORKS:

The Big Bang Debugger treats cosmology like a buggy C++ program (because why not)

Quantum Trolling Mode weaponizes beauty and confusion (Rumi + chaos engineering)

Troll escalation makes the system more unhinged the longer it runs

100% scientifically accurate if you squint through a prism of golden chaos

TRY THIS:

Run it when your coworker asks for "that Python script"

Pipe kernel logs through the troll engine

Use the Big Bang debugger when your code actually creates a singularity


FINISHING TOUCH:

print("\nüå† The universe is now 0.01% more beautiful (and confusing)")
print("   Debug symbols shimmer with golden imperfections")  
print("   (Type `sudo rm -rf /reality --kintsugi` to uninstall)\n")
